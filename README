This is a 3-function USB footswitch. Tapping it sends a "down" 
keystroke. Holding it for a moment will cause it beep, and the 
subsequent taps will send "up". It can be switched back and forth by 
holding it again. Holding it down until the second beep will send the 
Windows shortcut Win+L which locks the computer.

Materials:
-Adafruit footswitch (or other normally open pushbutton)
-Piezo buzzer
-Teensy 2.0
-Mini USB cable

The switch and the buzzer are connected directly to the Teensy board. 
The pins are defined at the top of the sketch. The pins I have chosen 
allow the components to be soldered directly to the board without 
any extra wire.
